# 🎶 Spotify Tracks EDA Project

## 🌟 Overview
Hey there! 👋  
This is a simple **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** project on **Spotify Tracks**.  
The goal was to explore the dataset, understand different **audio features**, and see what kind of patterns make a song popular on Spotify.  

It includes:
- A **Jupyter Notebook** (`.ipynb`) with all the analysis, graphs, and code  
- A **PowerPoint Presentation** (`.pptx`) that summarizes the results in a clean, easy-to-read format

## 🎯 What I Wanted to Find Out
Some of the questions I tried to answer:
- What features make a song more popular on Spotify?  
- How do things like **danceability**, **energy**, and **valence** affect popularity?  
- Which **genres or artists** tend to have high popularity scores?  
- Are there any clear correlations between audio features?
